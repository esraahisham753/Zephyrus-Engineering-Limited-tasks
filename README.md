## Overview

This repository contains the solutions to the coding challenge tasks provided as part of the Front-End Developer position application. The challenge includes three JavaScript coding tasks and one front-end implementation task using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

---

## Tasks and Solutions

### **Task 1: Reverse String (JavaScript)**
- **File**: `task1_reverse_string.js`
- **Description**:  
  A JavaScript function that takes a string as input and returns the reversed string.
- **Usage**:  
  Call the function `reverseString(input)` with a string argument to get the reversed result.

---

### **Task 2: FizzBuzz (JavaScript)**
- **File**: `task2_fizzbuzz.js`
- **Description**:  
  A JavaScript function that prints numbers from 1 to 100. Replaces multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both with "FizzBuzz".
- **Usage**:  
  Call the function `fizzBuzz()` to log the output in the console.

---

### **Task 3: Even or Odd (JavaScript)**
- **File**: `task3_even_or_odd.js`
- **Description**:  
  A JavaScript function that checks whether a given integer is even or odd and returns the result as a string.
- **Usage**:  
  Call the function `evenOrOdd(number)` with an integer to get `"Even"` or `"Odd"`.

---

### **Task 4: Simple Interactive Feature (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)**
- **File**: `task4_interactive_feature.html`
- **Description**:  
  A small HTML page with the following features:
  - A heading (`<h1>`) that displays an initial message.
  - A button that, when clicked, changes the text of the heading.
  - Basic CSS to style the page for a clean and presentable appearance.
- **Usage**:  
  Open the `task4_interactive_feature.html` file in a web browser and interact with the button to see the dynamic text change.

---

## How to Run the Solutions

1. **JavaScript Tasks (1-3)**:  
   - Open the `.js` files in a code editor or browser console.  
   - Copy and paste the code into the browser console or run it with Node.js to see the results.

2. **Front-End Task (Task 4)**:  
   - Open the `task4_interactive_feature.html` file in any modern web browser to view and interact with the page.

---

## Challenges and Approach

1. **Reverse String**:  
   Utilized the `split()`, `reverse()`, and `join()` methods for a concise solution.
   
2. **FizzBuzz**:  
   Used conditional statements and the modulus operator to determine the appropriate output for each number.

3. **Even or Odd**:  
   Leveraged the modulus operator and a ternary operator for simplicity and readability.

4. **Interactive Feature**:  
   Focused on clean DOM manipulation using `getElementById` and `addEventListener` for a dynamic user experience. Added simple CSS for aesthetic appeal.

## Notes

- All solutions follow clean and readable coding standards.
- No external libraries or frameworks were used, ensuring lightweight and efficient code.
